#Why man Don't Iron

A lot of people believe that society  — our family, friends and teachers — teachers boys and girls behave differently. They say that as adults we should change this. The ‘new man’ should cook, look after the children, be more emotional and less aggressive. He should be tidier, more cooperative and better listener . But is this change impossible for men? Can men be as cooperative as women, for example? 
The differences are obvious from very early age. At school, boys are messier and more competitive than girls: boys like to win! But girls are better students: they’re more hardworking than boys and they do more homework. Girls may be more talkative than boys, but boys are noisier. Some doctors believe that baby girls are stronger than baby boys. Why? Does society change us?
It their book ‘Why men Don’t Iron’ Anne and Bill Moir explain their view that men are more aggressive, more active, etc., because they are born that way. And society can’t change their behavior.
