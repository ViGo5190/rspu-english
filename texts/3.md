# SELECT HIM, AND YOU GET ME

President-elect Bill Clinton’s advisers originally considerer his wife Hillary 
, who can make (him) impressive 40-minute speech without notes, as their secret weapon. Hillary had her tole, her (**ne)-table ad her own staff in the election campaign, but few campaigners people would ask her why she wasn’t the candidate, why she herself (wasn’t) running. «Elect him, and you get me, « has Hillary Clinton’s usual retort. «Bey one, get the second free,» declared Covernor Bill Clinton, (**) the small southern stats of Arkansas, from (**obile) rostrums.

In the final frenzied days of the presidential race, whenever the Democratic candidate, suffer-(**g) from allergy and strained vocal chords, lost (his) voice completely, his wife would take over. (She) attacked her husband’s challengers with the (skill) and rhetoric of an experienced lawyer. Fol-(**wing) her addresses the crowd would roar, « Bil-lary! Bil-lary!» The people of their home (*wn) Little Rock paraded signs, «Hillary for White House» on their car bumpers as if it was (**e), and not her husband, who was the chief rival (F) Republican President George Bush and independent candidate Rosss Perot.

In one of his interviews Bill Clinton said it was Hillary who persuaded him to run for the presidency. He also admitted that his wife was far better organized, more in control, more eloquent and more intelligent. The latter is especially remarkable because it comes from a man who, ()spired early in his life by John F.Kennedy’s example, had made a public and political career ()is life-long ambition. Success came to him early, ()o: at 31 he was elected the Governor of Arkansas for the first time.

But it is not only her husband who speaks for Hillary. Nobody knew anything about Barbara Bush, now dubbed «America;s Grandma» and ()e «silver Fox», before her husband George ()epped up from vice-presidency to presidency. ()olumes were written about Hillary Clinton, her () and her character, long before she became America’s first lady.
